## My process

I started by looking at figma files and writing down the possible routes I can take in terms of setting up my files. I then strctured my HTML file, then i used the figma file to get the appropriate colors and sizing to set up my CSS file.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

This project was really fun to do. I got achace to untilize the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) and practice fetching data from an API which is one my favorite things to do.

### Continued development

In the future, i would like to add a copy to clipboard button.
